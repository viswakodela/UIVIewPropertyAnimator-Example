# UIVIewPropertyAnimator-Example

In this project i am experimenting how to get the UI that we all see in the Apple Maps, Siri Short cuts. which is a bottom container view that we can use to pull up and down. UIViewPropertyAnimator API was released in iOS 10, which helps to create Interactive Animation.
